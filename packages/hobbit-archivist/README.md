Hobbit archivist is part of the [Hobbit framework](https://github.com/Minivera/mithril-hobbit) for mithril. It offers a complete system to store and observe an application's state from a central location. This package is heavily inspired from system like [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Cerebral](https://cerebraljs.com/).

The state management system is easy to use and extremely light - weighing less than XKB - bringing the whole mithril package to just about Y KB.

It does not support any JSX structure (Yet).

To install Hobbit archivist, either install the hobbit framework or this package individually through npm:
